# TimeKeeper

Problem being solved: A Company needs documentation that salaried employees did or did not work overtime each week (track weekly hours in case of audit).

Employees will receive a text reminder to fill out their hours. Managers (Admin) will receive requests with choice to accept / deny.
Records are kept in case the company is audited.
